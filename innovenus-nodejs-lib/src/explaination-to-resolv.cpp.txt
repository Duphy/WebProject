//Explaination of resolv.cpp

//This source file includes the basic functions of resolving the packs.

//Structure:

resovPack (const Arguments& args)    //args[0] is the pack

Local<Object>	resolvViewPack(pack,subtype) //pack is the pack which we are dealing with. Subtype 					     //is the subtype of the pack, is a int. Local<Object> 					     //is the type of the result of resolving the pack

Local<Object>	resolvSearch(pack,subtype)

Local<Object>	resolvCreate(pack,subtype)
	
Local<Object>	resolvUpdatePack(pack,subtype)

Local<Object>	resolvReply(pack,subtype)

Local<Object>	resolvDelete(pack,subtype)

Local<Object>	resolvValidationPack(pack,subtype)

Local<Object>	resolvQuit(pack,subtype)

Local<Object>	resolvSuggestion(pack,subtype)

Local<Object>	resolvMessage(pack,subtype)

//Other basic functions used to read:

resolvHexbit(char a) //change the char a to int

readBytes(char *dist, char *buf, int& pointer, int length) 

Local<Array> JSreadBytes(char *buf, int &pointer, int length) //the functions which begins with 							      	      //Local means it would be 							      		      //transferred to the type which 							     		      //javascript can directly use

void readAsciiString(char *dist, char *buf, int& pointer, int length)

Local<String> JSreadAsciiString(char *buf, int &pointer, int length) 

void readString(uint16_t *dist, char *buf, int &pointer, int length)

Local<String> JSreadString(char *buf, int &pointer, int length)

int64_t readInteger(char *buf, int& pointer, int length)

Local<Integer> JSreadInteger(char *buf, int &pointer, int length)

bool readBool(char *buf, int &pointer)


//The functions which are used to resolve some specific cases

Handle<Boolean> JSreadBool(char *buf, int &pointer) 

void extract_header(char *buf, response_header* ans)

Local<Object> formJSHeader(response_header *header)   //used to form the header by pack in resolvPack

Local<Array> resolvUIDs(char *pack, int &pointer)     //used to resolve more than one UIDs, pack is the pack which we are resovling now, pointer refers to the address of the pack which we are at.

Local<Object> resolvEventSimpleOtherPack(char *pack, int &pointer)

Local<Object> resolvUserSimplePack(char *pack, int &pointer) 

Local<Object> resolvUserSettingPack(char *pack, int &pointer)

//the seven functions above are all used to resolve some special cases

Local<Object> resolvSchedule(char *pack, int &pointer)	//used to resolve Schedule

Local<Array> resolvSchedules(char *pack, int &pointer)  //used to resolve more than one Schedules

Local<Object> resolvUpdate(char *pack, int &pointer)	//used to resolve Update
