The tentative workflow is as follows:

Front End:

- Powered by HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript
- User fill up the form, click buttons to trigger events
- HTML or JavaScript will initialise a HTTP Request
- Validate the formats of inputs
- Use HTTP Request to talk to a PHP Page at backend


Back End:

- PHP Page will respond to the HTTP Request
- According to the contents of the HTTP Request, PHP will make a Package
- PHP then throw the Package to Database Server (PHP Page may implement an API to talk to the Database Server, aka the database abstraction layer)

Database Server:

- Unpack the Package from PHP Page
- Do necessary checkups and read/write
- Make a Package for the PHP Page

Back End:

- Unpack the resultant Package
- Send to Front End as the result of HTTP Request

Front End:

- Render and display the page
